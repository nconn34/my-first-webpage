  <h1>NBA Season Predictions!</h1>
  <h2>Just some random thoughts about the 75th NBA Season!</h2>
  <p>First things first: The Greek Freak will protect his crown!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Giannis will have developed a more stout game in the post, and he will Euro-step Milwaukee to a repeat title!</li>
      <li>Jrue Holiday will continue to be the defensive engine!</li>
      <li>Khris Middleton will have his best year yet!</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Other notes...</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Kyrie will retire and come back in two years</li>
     <li>James Harden will go to Philadelphia next year and with Embiid will be perrennial contenders</li>
     <li>Devin Booker and Zion Williamson will somehow end up on a team together</li>
     <li>Ben Simmons played his last relevant game for quite some time</li>
    </ol>
